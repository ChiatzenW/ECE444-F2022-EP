## Build and run with Docker

For detailed instructions on Docker, please refer to the documents for Lab3 on Quercus.

+ Change the proxy link in package. Remember to change it back to "http://localhost:5000/"
```json
// Part of Education_Pathways/frontend/package.json
"private": true,
"proxy": "http://host.docker.internal:5000/",
```

```powershell
# Under the root directory
docker compose up --build
```

## How to deploy (not required for lab3)

Please make sure everything works well before you run it with docker.

+ Make sure the baseURL is set as [URL to your deployed project]
```javascript
// Education_Pathways/frontend/src/api.js
export default axios.create({
   baseURL: "[URL to your deployed project]" -- baseURL for deployment
});
```
+ Re-build the frontend to update the baseURL
```powershell
# Under the frontend/ directory
npm run build
```
+ Deploy your changes to heroku
```powershell
git push heroku main
```
